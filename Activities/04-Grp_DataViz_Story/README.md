# DataViz Story

## Instructions

* Create a map or multiple maps (layers) and plot one or more of the following Boston GeoJSON datasets provided in the [04-Grp_DataViz_Story/Unsolved/static/data](Unsolved/static/data) folder. 

* The datasets were downloaded from the following links: 
  * The [Wicked_Free_Wi-Fi_Locations.geojson](https://data.boston.gov/dataset/wicked-free-wi-fi-locations1) is Boston's outdoor wireless network. The data is Point geometry. 
  * The [Charging_Stations.geojson](https://data.boston.gov/dataset/charging-stations1) is Point geometry.  
  * The [Boston_Neighborhoods.geojson](https://data.boston.gov/dataset/boston-neighborhoods1) is MulitPolygon geometry. 
  * The [Fire_Districts.geojson](https://data.boston.gov/dataset/fire-districts1) is MulitPolygon geometry.
  * The [Fire_Departments.geojson](https://data.boston.gov/dataset/fire-departments1) is Point geometry.
  * The [Police_Districts.geojson](https://data.boston.gov/dataset/police-districts1) is MulitPolygon geometry.
  * The [Boston_Police_Stations.geojson](https://data.boston.gov/dataset/boston-police-stations1) is Point geometry.

* For the data visualization story include:
  * What is the purpose for choosing the data for your story?
  * How did you map the data?
    * Did you used multiple overlays and layers (maps)?
    * Did you provide popups for the markers? 
    * Did you add color to the MulitPolygon geometry features so they stand out? 
  * What does the mapped data show the viewer?  

* Suggested maps include:
  * What neighborhoods have the most / least free public wi-fi locations, electrical vehicle charging, police, or fire stations?
  * What police or fire districts have the most / least police or fire departments? 

* If you would like to use different Boston datasets or add more information to your visualization you can search at [data.boston.gov](https://data.boston.gov/dataset).  

* **Hint:** To see the objects in each GeoJSON file, make a copy of the file and save it as a `.json` file, then open it up in the FireFox browser or in Chrome if you have the JSONView plugin.
