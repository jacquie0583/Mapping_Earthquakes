# City Markers

In this activity, you will create a map and plot markers for five US cities.

## Instructions

* Create an array with the following US cities in the format:

   ```javascript
   var cities = [{
      location: [40.7128, -74.0059],
      name: "New York",
      population: "8,550,405"
   
   },
   ]
   ```

* Find the latitude and longitude and recent population, or you can make up population to save time for the following cities and add them the to the `cities` array.

   * Los Angeles
   * Houston
   * Omaha
   * Chicago

* Loop through the `cities` array and create one marker for each city, bind a popup containing its name and population add it to the map.

## Bonus

* Refactor your code to use `forEach()` to loop through the `cities` array and create one marker for each city, bind a popup containing its name and population, and add it to the map.

## Hints

* Don't forget to add the marker to your map after creating it!
